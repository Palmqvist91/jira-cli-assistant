# Jira CLI Assistant

- Refactor CLI command syntax to use verb first. e.g. `jira list projects` instead of `jira projects list`.

## Features

- List all Jira projects
- List issues for a specific project with filtering options
- Create new issues in a project
- Update existing issues
- Delete issues

## Installation
